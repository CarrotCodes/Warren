# Warren

Kotlin, unit tested, IRC v3.2 state management and observing. Made for personal use, and open sourced. Intended to provide the tools needed to make IRC related software, like bridges and bots.

[Kale](https://github.com/CarrotCodes/Kale) is the parsing and serialising counterpart.

[Thump](https://github.com/CarrotCodes/Thump) is the primary upstream project - a bridge that lets people chat between Minecraft and IRC whilst they play.

Though still in active development, it remains stable enough for Thump to use. Thump, Warren and Kale drive requirements between themselves.

## Why should you use this framework?

Warren and Kale have a few advantages over other IRC frameworks:

* The responsibilities of parsing and state management are separated
* Both parsing and state management are verified by hundreds of unit tests
* Messages, and state handlers, are individually encapsulated

Note that this project is still pretty new. Planned features are tracked in [Issues](https://github.com/CarrotCodes/Warren/issues).

## Example usage

The project includes a simple [example runner](https://github.com/CarrotCodes/Warren/blob/develop/src/main/kotlin/engineer/carrot/warren/warren/WarrenRunner.kt) that prints out events as they happen, logs in using SASL and replies to me saying `rabbit party` in a channel.

If you're interested in more complex usage, come talk to me on IRC: #carrot on [ImaginaryNet](http://imaginarynet.uk/)

```kotlin
val events = WarrenEventDispatcher()
events.onAnything {
    LOGGER.info("event: $it")
}

val sasl = SaslConfiguration(account = nickname, password = password)

val factory = WarrenFactory(ServerConfiguration(server, port, useTLS), UserConfiguration(nickname, sasl = sasl),
                            ChannelsConfiguration(mapOf("#botdev" to null)), EventConfiguration(events, fireIncomingLineEvent = true))
val connection = factory.create()

events.on(ChannelMessageEvent::class) {
    LOGGER.info("channel message: $it")

    if (it.user.nick == "carrot" && it.message.equals("rabbit party", ignoreCase = true)) {
        connection.eventSink.add(SendSomethingEvent(PrivMsgMessage(target = it.channel, message = "üê∞üéâ"), connection.sink))
    }
}

connection.run()
```

## TODO

* [RFC 1459](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1459) - done
* [IRC v3](http://ircv3.net/irc/)
 * 3.1 base done
 * Goal is full 3.1 and 3.2 compliance by default
