# Warren

Kotlin, unit tested, IRC v3.2 state management and observing.

[Kale](https://github.com/CarrotCodes/Kale) is the parsing and serialising counterpart.

[Thump](https://github.com/CarrotCodes/Thump) is the primary upstream project - a bridge that lets people chat between Minecraft and IRC whilst they play.

## Why is this better than other IRC frameworks?

Warren and Kale have a few advantages over other IRC frameworks:

* The responsibilities of parsing and state management are separated
* Both parsing and state management are verified by hundreds of unit tests
* Messages, and state handlers, are individually encapsulated
 * Dependencies are clear, and there are no enormous, unverifiable disaster zones

## Example usage

The project includes a simple [example runner](https://github.com/CarrotCodes/Warren/blob/develop/src/main/kotlin/engineer/carrot/warren/warren/WarrenRunner.kt) that prints out events as they happen, logs in using SASL and replies to me saying `rabbit party` in a channel.

```kotlin
val eventDispatcher = WarrenEventDispatcher()
eventDispatcher.onAnythingListeners += {
    println("event: $it")
}

val connection = createRunner(server, port, (port != 6667), nickname, password, mapOf("#botdev" to null), eventDispatcher, fireIncomingLineEvent = true)

eventDispatcher.onChannelMessageListeners += {
    println("channel message: $it")

    if (it.user.nick == "carrot" && it.message.equals("rabbit party", ignoreCase = true)) {
        connection.eventSink.add(SendSomethingEvent(PrivMsgMessage(target = it.channel, message = "üê∞üéâ"), connection.sink))
    }
}

connection.run()
```

## TODO

* [RFC 1459](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1459)
 * Essentials are done - last remaining thing is MODE tracking
* [IRC v3](http://ircv3.net/irc/)
 * 3.1 done
 * Goal is full 3.1 and 3.2 compliance by default
